# 6170 Animal Cognition | HUJI

This repository contains data from a set of experiments described in the paper:  
[Forkosh et al., Nature Neuroscience (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0516-y)

In each experiment, **four adult male mice** were housed together for **four or more days** in a **shared enriched arena**. The arena included:

- A closed nest
- Two feeders
- Two water bottles
- Two ramps
- An open shelter
- An S-shaped separation wall in the center

---

The repository contains two types of data:

1. Full tracking data - found under `tracks/`
2. Behavioral data - found in `daily.csv`

---

## 1. Tracking Data | `tracks/`

The files found under `tracks/` are compressed HDF5 files. To open them in python it is recommanded to use [mat73](https://pypi.org/project/mat73/):

```python
pip install mat73
```

Then:

```python
import mat73
cheese = mat73.loadmat('tracks/THREE_CHAMBER-exp.exp0011.day01.cam01.mp4.obj.mat', 'r')
```

Each CheeseCube has the following fields:

- **Tracking**: the tracking data including the x, y positions of each mouse. Each of the positions are listed as a matrix of size n_mice x n_time_points.
- **ROI**: information about the mouse arena (size, ROIs, etc.)
- **Background**: an image of the arena without the mice
- **Hierarchy**: behavioral analysis
- **Colors**: color information about the mice
- **Meta**: metadata like remarks, time range, and general information

---

## 2. Behavioral Data | `daily.csv`

This CSV file contains **daily behavioral metrics** for each mouse.

### Structure

Each row represents **one mouse on one day** of the experiment.

**Key columns:**
| Column | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `Day` | Day of the experiment (usually between 1–4) |
| `MouseNumber` | Unique identifier for the mouse |
| `MouseID` | ID of the mouse within its group (usually 1–4) — note: `MouseID` is **not** globally unique |
| `GroupNumber` | Group ID (use this, rather than `GroupID`) |
| `GroupID` | [!Deprecated] Avoid using this — `GroupNumber` is preferred |

In addition to these identifiers, each row includes a rich set of **behavioral metrics**, described below.

### Behavioral Traits & Metrics

The features fall into two categories:

- **Pairwise Metrics**: Social interactions and comparisons with other mice
- **Individual Metrics**: Exploration, movement, preferences, and spatial behavior

#### Pairwise Behavioral Metrics

| Behavior                        | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time outside**                | Fraction of time the mouse is outside the nest                                      |
| **Visit rate outside**          | How often the mouse exits the nest                                                  |
| **Foraging correlation**        | Synchrony with other mice in being outside                                          |
| **Contact rate & time**         | Number and duration of contacts with other mice (<10 cm apart outside the nest)     |
| **Follow / Being followed**     | Times one mouse follows or is followed by another after contact (aggressive or not) |
| **Chase / Escape**              | Chases another or is chased aggressively (machine-classified)                       |
| **Approach / Being approached** | Initiates or receives directed approach ending in contact                           |
| **Approach-escape**             | Initiates contact but ends up being chased                                          |
| **Approach–chase difference**   | Difference between number of approaches and chases                                  |

#### Individual Behavioral Metrics

| Behavior                                                 | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exploration (ROI & grid)**                             | Entropy-based measure of how uniformly the mouse explores regions or grid |
| **Predictability**                                       | Mutual information between successive locations (6×6 grid)                |
| **Distance traveled**                                    | Total path length outside the nest                                        |
| **Speed (mean / median)**                                | Movement speed outside the nest                                           |
| **Tangential / Angular velocity**                        | Measures of movement path curvature                                       |
| **Food & water zone use**                                | Time spent near feeders and water bottles                                 |
| **Feeder / Water preference**                            | Bias toward feeder/water location closer to nest                          |
| **Elevated area / Ramps / S-wall / Shelter / Open area** | Time spent in various zones                                               |
| **Distance from walls / nest**                           | Spatial positioning in open area                                          |
| **Alone outside**                                        | Time spent outside when all others are in the nest                        |

#### Notes on Units & Normalizations

Each metric includes one or more **normalized versions**, e.g.:

- Per hour of total time (`per 1 h`)
- Per hour of time outside the nest
- Per contact
- As a fraction of total time
- Arbitrary units (`a.u.`), where a unit does not have a direct physical meaning but is consistent across comparisons

You can refer to the original paper for deeper methodological details and normalization logic.
